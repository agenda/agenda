Agenda is a light-weight job scheduling library for Node.js. 

It offers:

- Minimal overhead. Agenda aims to keep its code base small.
- Mongo backed persistance layer.
- Scheduling with configurable priority, concurrency, and repeating
- Scheduling via cron or human readable syntax.
- Event backed job queue that you can hook into.

# Installation

Install via NPM

    npm install agenda

# Example Usage

```js
var agenda = new Agenda({db: { address: 'localhost:27017/agenda-example'}});

agenda.define('delete old users', function(job, done) {
  User.remove({lastLogIn: { $lt: twoDaysAgo }}, done);
});

agenda.every('3 minutes', 'delete old users');

// Alternatively, you could also do:

agenda.every('*/3 * * * *', 'delete old users');

agenda.start();
```

```js
agenda.define('send email report', {priority: 'high', concurrency: 10}, function(job, done) {
  var data = job.attrs.data;
  emailClient.send({ 
    to: data.to,
    from: 'example@example.com',
    subject: 'Email Report',
    body: '...'
  }, done);
});

agenda.schedule('in 20 minutes', 'send email report', {to: 'admin@example.com'});
agenda.start();
```

```js
var weeklyReport = agenda.schedule('Saturday at noon', 'send email report', {to: 'another-guy@example.com'});
weeklyReport.repeatEvery('1 week').save();
agenda.start();
```

# Full documentation

Agenda's basic control structure is an instance of an agenda. Agenda's are
mapped to a database collection and load the jobs from within.

## Configuring an agenda 
All configuration methods are chainable, meaning you can do something like:

```js
var agenda = new Agenda();
agenda
  .database(...)
  .processEvery('3 minutes')
  ...;
```

### database(url, [collectionName])

Specifies the database at the `url` specified. If no collection name is give,
`agendaJobs` is used.

```js
agenda.database('localhost:27017/agenda-test', 'agendaJobs');
```

You can also specify it during instantiation.

```js
var agenda = new Agenda({db: { address: 'localhost:27017/agenda-test', collection: 'agendaJobs' }});
```

### processEvery(interval)

Takes a string `interval` which can be either a traditional javascript number,
or a string such as `3 minutes`

Specifies the frequency at which agenda will query the database looking for jobs
that need to be processed. If your jobs are time sensitive, you will want to
specify a low value.

```js
agenda.processEvery('1 minute');
```

You can also specify it during instantiation

```js
var agenda = new Agenda({processEvery: '30 seconds'});
```

### maxConcurrency(number)

Takes a `number` which specifies the max number of jobs that can be running at
any given moment. By default it is `20`.

```js
agenda.maxConcurrency(20);
```

You can also specify it during instantiation

```js
var agenda = new Agenda({maxConcurrency: 20});
```

### defaultConcurrency(number)

Takes a `number` which specifies the default number of a specific that can be running at
any given moment. By default it is `5`.

```js
agenda.defaultConcurrency(5);
```

You can also specify it during instantiation

```js
var agenda = new Agenda({defaultConcurrency: 5});
```


## Defining Job Processors

Before you can use a job, you must define its processing behavior.

### define(jobName, [options], fn)

Defines a job with the name of `jobName`. When a job of job name gets run, it
will be passed to `fn(job, done)`. To maintain asynchronous behavior, you must
call `done()` when you are processing the job. If your function is synchronous,
you may omit `done` from the signature.

`options` is an optional argument which can overwrite the defaults. It can take
the following:

- `concurrency`: `number` maxinum number of that job that can be running at once
- `priority`: `(lowest|low|normal|high|highest|number)` specifies the priority
  of the job. Higher priority jobs will run first. See the priority mapping
  below

Priority mapping:
```
{
  highest: 20,
  high: 10,
  default: 0,
  low: -10,
  lowest: -20
}
```

Async Job:
```js
agenda.define('some long running job', function(job, done) {
  doSomelengthyTask(function(data) {
    formatThatData(data);
    sendThatData(data);
    done();
  });
});
```

Sync Job:

```js
agenda.define('say hello', function(job) {
  console.log("Hello!");
});
```

## Creating Jobs

### every(interval, name, [data])

Runs job `name` at the given `interval`. Optionally, data can be passed in.
Every creates a job of type `single`, which means that it will only create one
job in the database, even if that line is run multiple times. This lets you put
it in a file that may get run multiple times, such as `webserver.js` which may
reboot from time to time.

`interval` can be a human-readable format `String`, a cron format `String`, or a `Number`.

`data` is an optional argument that will be passed to the processing function
under `job.attrs.data`.

Returns the `job`.

```js
agenda.define('printAnalyticsReport', function(job, done) {
  User.doSomethingReallyIntensive(function(err, users) {
    processUserData();
    console.log("I print a report!");
    done();
  });
});

agenda.every('15 minutes', 'printAnalyticsReport');
```

### schedule(when, name, data)

Schedules a job to run `name` once at a given time. `when` can be a `Date` or a
`String` such as `tomorrow at 5pm`.

`data` is an optional argument that will be passed to the processing function
under `job.data`.

Returns the `job`.


```js
agenda.schedule('tomorrow at noon', 'printAnalyticsReport', {userCount: 100});
```

### create(jobName, data)

Returns an instance of a `jobName` with `data`. This does *NOT* save the job in
the database. See below to learn how to manually work with jobs.

```js
var job = agenda.create('printAnalyticsReport', {userCount: 100});
job.save(function(err) {
  console.log("Job successfully saved");
});
```

## Starting the job processor

To get agenda to start processing jobs from the database you must start it. This
will schedule an interval (based on `processEvery`) to check for new jobs and
run them. You can also stop the queue.

### start

Starts the job queue processing, checking `processEvery` time to see if there
are new jobs.

### stop

Stops the job queue processing.


## Manually working with a job

A job instance has many instance methods. All mutating methods must be followed
with a call to `job.save()` in order to persist the changes to the database.


### repeatEvery(interval)

Specifies an `interval` on which the job should repeat.

`interval` can be a human-readable format `String`, a cron format `String`, or a `Number`.

```js
job.repeatEvery('10 minutes');
job.save();
```

### schedule(time)

Specifies the next `time` at which the job should repeat.

```js
job.schedule('tomorrow at 6pm');
job.save();
```

### priority(priority)

Specifies the `priority` weighting of the job. Can be a number or a string from
the above priority table.

```js
job.priority('low');
job.save();
```

### fail(reason)

Sets `job.attrs.failedAt` to `now`, and sets `job.attrs.failReason`
to `reason`.

```js
job.fail('insuficient disk space');
job.save();
```

### run(callback)

Runs the given `job` and calls `callback(err, job)` upon completion. Normally
you never need to call this manually.

```js
job.run(function(err, job) {
  console.log("I don't know why you would need to do this...");
});
```

### save(callback)

Saves the `job.attrs` into the database.

```js
job.save(function(err) {
    if(!err) console.log("Successfully saved job to collection");
})
```

## Job Queue Events

An instance of an agenda will emit the following events:

- `complete` - called when a job finishes, regardless of if it succeeds or fails
- `complete:job name` - called when a job finishes, regardless of if it succeeds or fails

```js
agenda.on('complete', function(job) {
  console.log("Job %s finished", job.attrs.name);
});
```

- `success` - called when a job finishes successfully
- `success:job name` - called when a job finishes successfully

```js
agenda.once('success:send email', function(job) {
  console.log("Sent Email Successfully to: %s", job.attrs.data.to);
});
```

- `fail` - called when a job throws an error
- `fail:job name` - called when a job throws an error

```js
agenda.on('fail:send email', function(err, job) {
  console.log("Job failed with error: %s", err.message);
});
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Mongo vs Redis

The decision to use Mongo instead of Redis is intentional. Redis is often used for
non-essential data (such as sessions) and without configuration doesn't
guarantee the same level of persistence as Mongo (should the server need to be
restarted/crash). 

Agenda decides to focus on persistence without requiring special configuration
of Redis (thereby degrading the performance of the Redis server on non-critical
data, such as sessions). 

Ultimately if enough people want a Redis driver instead of Mongo, I will write
one. (Please open an issue requesting it). For now, Agenda decided to focus on
guaranteed persistence.
